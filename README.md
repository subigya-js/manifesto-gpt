# Manifesto GPT 🗳️🤖

**Manifesto GPT** is an open-source, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) powered chatbot platform designed to help citizens explore, understand, and compare the election manifestos of political parties in Nepal.

## 🚀 Vision

Our mission is to make political manifestos accessible and interactive. Instead of scrolling through lengthy PDF documents, users can ask specific questions about a party's stance on education, health, economy, or any other policy area and get instant, AI-driven answers based on official documents.

## ✨ Features

- **Party-Specific Chat**: Dedicated chat sessions for major political parties including:
  - Nepali Congress (NC)
  - CPN (UML)
  - Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP)
  - Shram Sanskriti Party (SSP)
- **Manifesto Comparison**: A side-by-side comparison tool to evaluate different party visions and policies.
- **AI-Powered Insights**: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation to ensure answers are grounded in actual manifesto text. (Coming Soon)
- **Source Documents**: The platform is built using the official 2024 manifestos, which can be found in the `docs/` directory.
- **Premium Dark UI**: A sleek, minimal, and modern interface built for focused exploration.
